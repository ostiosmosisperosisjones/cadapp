BaseTool — interface every sketch drawing tool must implement.

A tool instance is created when the user activates that tool and discarded
when they switch tools or exit sketch mode.  All in-progress state (e.g.
the first point of a line, the center of an arc) lives on the instance.

Methods
-------
handle_click(snap_result, sketch)
    Called on every left-click while this tool is active.
    snap_result : SnapResult  — resolved cursor (already snapped)
    sketch      : SketchMode  — append entities here
    Returns True if the click was consumed.

handle_mouse_move(snap_result, sketch)
    Called on every mouse-move.  Update preview state here.

cancel()
    Called when ESC is pressed within the tool.  Reset in-progress state
    (e.g. drop the pending line start) but do NOT switch tools — the
    tool stays active.  A second ESC at SketchMode level switches to NONE.

cursor_2d
    Property — current snapped cursor position for the overlay, or None.
